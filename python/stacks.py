# The purpose of this script is to provide a new command 'stacks' to a
# Python-enabled GDB to report the minimum free stack space for all
# tasks in the system, by
# (a) using a chain in the RTS linking all tasks
# (b) using FreeRTOS task data to access Task Control Block
#     information
# (c) checking the task stack to see where the initialised value
#     changes.
#
# Requirements:
# (a) FreeRTOSConfig.h must contain one or more of
#       configCHECK_FOR_STACK_OVERFLOW > 1
#       configUSE_TRACE_FACILITY == 1
#       INCLUDE_uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark == 1
# (b) The RTS must be compiled for debugging (-XBUILD=Debug, the default)
#
# Usage:
# (gdb) source /where/ever/stacks.py
# (gdb) stacks
# min free:  2880 , tag:  0x2000a9dc <ada.real_time.timing_events.timer+4>
# min free:  1304 , tag:  0x2000ad9c <environment_task.environment_tcb>
#
# where
# 'min free' is the minimum free stack ever used
# 'tag' indicates the task (it's the address of the procedure created
#   by the compiler to initiate the task)
#
# Inspired by github.com:girtsf/FreeRTOS-GDB.git
